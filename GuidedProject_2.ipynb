    "\n",
    "In this project I will work with a data set of submissions posted to the website Hacker News. The data set has been reduced substantially from 300k rows to 20k; this was done by removing submissions that did not recieve any comment and randomly sampling the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project requires specific attention and interest on posts whose titles begin with either **Ask HN** or **Show HN**. **Ask HN** is used to submit a question and **Show HN** is used to show something. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the project is to compare the two post types and determine the following:\n",
    " * Do Ask HN or Show HN recieve more comments on average? \n",
    " * Do posts created at a certain time recieve more comments on average?\n",
    " \n",
